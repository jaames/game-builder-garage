BYML Notes
----------

Key format:

Keys for BYML hash nodes are hashed, so the original name isn't immediately obvious
The hashed key is calculated by crc32'ing a combination of the original key name and the key type
If it's an array, the key name crc32(name + '[].' + type), otherwise it's crc32(name + '.' + type)

Key type strings:

bool
f32, f64
s8, s16, s32, s64
u8, u16, u32, u64
Bit
C4f, C4u8
Curvef
Enum
Rangei, Rangef
Q4f
Str
V2i, V3i, V4i
V2f, V3f, V4f
